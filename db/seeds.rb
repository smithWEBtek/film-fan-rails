# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Genre.create!([{name: 'Action'},  {name: 'rom-com'}])

# Movie.create!(title: "Dark Knight Rises", director: "Nolan", year: 2008, description: "A new take on a superhero film.", inventory: 1, user_id: 1, genre_id: 1, user_watched: 1)
